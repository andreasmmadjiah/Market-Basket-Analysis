1. Apriori Algorithm (Ascociation Rules)
In this part, we use apriori to analyze which frequently bought together items in transaction data (DataPurchase.csv) using Manual (Credit by zhaopace@foxmail.com) and using Python's modules Apyori.
Using apriori, we found that in our data, there are some items that are frequently bough together (Music Pad-Camera) for example but has low lift, means that it still unlikely/low chance that those items bought together.
